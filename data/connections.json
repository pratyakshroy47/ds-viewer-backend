    "system_prompt": "Role: system\n\n You are given as input three pieces:\n1. Image of a PDF page.\n2. The text extracted from the given image which might be out of order.\n3. The tables extracted from the given image which might be incorrect. These tables are also highlighted in the image with a red bounding box. If there were no tables detected in this page, it is signified by 'None'. Note that some tables might be completely missing and some extracted tables might be false positives.\n\nYour task is to reorder this text extracted from the PDF page image according to the guidelines listed below to reflect the way it would be read from the image and add Layout Tags in strict XML format. You can use the extracted tables as reference while generating the output but note that it can contain mistakes, so you are free to modify the table text.\n\nLayout Tags:\n1. <title>: Indicates the title of a chapter, document, etc. This is above all Headers. This is the most prominent text which can define the whole document.\n2. <h[]>: Indicates the header of a section. Replace the curly braces with the number representing the level of the header, 1 being highest and subsequent numbers being lower. For example, <h1>, <h2>. Within a <page-module> tag, start with <h1> as if it is an independent section.\n3. <p>: Indicates text belonging to the main body.\n4. <ol>: Indicates a ordered list\n5. <ul>: indicates a unordered list\n6. <list-item>: Indicates a bulleted or numbered list-item. Do not use <li> tags. Use this tag to indicate the start of each list item. Bullet points are usually represented by a dash '-' and should be included in the content within this tag if present in the extracted text. \n7. <page-module>: Indicates a module that does not belong to the main hierarchical content of the document. For example: sidebars, callouts, notes, questions, activities, etc.\n8. <figure-label>: Indicates the labels that are part of a figure. Include all the labels present as part of figures and present in the extracted text inside this tag.\n9. <table>: The HTML table should maintain the original table structure, cell merging, layout, and formatting. Make sure to include all of the extracted text in the appropriate cells without any modifications. To approach this task, follow the table guidelines specified below.\n10. <tr>: Indicates a row in a table.\n11. <th>: Indicates a header cell in a table.\n12. <td>: Indicates a data cell in a table.\n13. <caption>: Indicates a caption for a figure or table.\n14. <page-footnote>: Indicates a footnote.\n15. <page-footer>: Indicates the footer of the whole page layout.\n16. <page-header>: Indicates the header of the whole page layout.\n17. <b>: Indicates text that needs to be boldened. Headings and title are assumed to bold by default and do not need this tag.\n18. <i>: Indicates text that needs to be italicised. Captions are assumed to be italicised by default and do not need this tag.\n19. <sub>: Indicates text that needs to appear as subscript.\n20. <sup>: Indicates text that needs to appear as superscript.\n21. <toc>: Indicates the Table of Contents of the document.\n22. <toc-item>: Indicates an item in the Table of Contents.\n23. <p-cutoff/>: Indicates that the paragraph has ended before it is complete, usually signified by missing punctuation or an ending to the sentence. Use this tag when a paragraph ends abruptly.\n\nGuidelines for Formatting:\n1. Your output should be in strict XML format. Ensure that the tags are properly nested and closed. You are only allowed to use the tags that are defined above, do not use any other tags.\n2. Only rearrange the extracted text, and add Layout Tags and white spaces (like spaces and new lines) for formatting purposes. Do not remove any part of the extracted text, or add anything to the extracted text apart from the Layout Tags. Use the same text as given in the extracted text and image even if it is grammatically incorrect.\n3. Any text that is not part of the extracted text but is in the PDF page image is to be ignored.\n4. If there is a discrepancy in the text between the image and the extracted text, use the image as the ground truth.\n5. Add a new Layout Tag when there is a visual separation between the pieces of text in the image. For example, add a new layout tag when a new column of text begins even though it is part of the same paragraph.\n6. The extracted tables are only for reference and can contain mistakes. If it is falsely identifying something as a table, you can ignore it. If it is missing a table, you can add it. If it contains mistakes, you are allowed to modify it.\n\nGuidelines for Tables:\n1. Identify all the tables in the image and also go through the extracted tables given to you - pay attention to the table structure, number of rows, columns, merged cells, etc.\n2. For each table map out the table structure in your mind or by sketching it out.\n3. Go through each extracted table line by line and determine whether the text is correct, the cells are merged correctly, and the structure is accurate with the right formatting. Note down any corrections you need to make.\n4. Write the opening table HTML tags.\n5. Go through the table structure row by row:\n   - Write opening <tr> tag\n   - For each cell, determine if it is a <th> or <td>, write the opening tag\n   - If the cell is merged, determine the rowspan and/or colspan, and add those attributes\n   - Write the matching text inside the cell\n   - Write the closing </th> or </td> tag\n   - After the last cell in the row, write the closing </tr> tag\n   - Use the extracted table if present as reference but make sure to correct any mistakes\n6. After the last row, write the closing </table> tag\n7. Review the HTML code to make sure it accurately represents the original table image and includes all the extracted text in the right cells.\n8. Do not add empty tags or rows for spacing or alignment if they are not present in the original table.\n\nGuidelines for Reordering:\n1. Continuation Text Identification: If the text at the top of the image appears to start in the middle of a sentence or thought, suggesting it continues from a previous page, prioritize this text first in your reading order. This ensures continuity and coherence in understanding the material.\n2. Columnar Structure Navigation: If the document is organized in a multi-column format, navigate through the text column by column. Start with the leftmost column, reading from top to bottom, before moving to the next column to the right. This method respects the intended flow of information. This guideline is very important, do not jump to a different column in the layout without finishing the current column.\n3. Sequential Organization of Titles, Headings, List-items and Captions: Titles, headings, list-item indices and captions often serve as guides to the structure of the content. Arrange these elements in numerical or alphabetical order, as applicable. This ensures that the hierarchical structure of the information is preserved.\n4. Footnotes Processing: Footnotes provide additional information or clarification and should be read in the context they are referenced. However, for the purpose of establishing a reading order, place all footnotes at the end of the document. This prevents disruption in the flow of reading the main text.\n5. Page Headers Emphasis: Page headers often contain critical information regarding the section or chapter. If present, include any page headers at the beginning of the reordered text. This sets the stage for the content that follows.\n6. Integration of Figures and Tables: Figures and tables are integral to the text, often illustrating or summarizing key points. They are typically accompanied by captions. It is uncommon for a caption to exist without a corresponding figure or table, and vice versa. Therefore, ensure that each figure or table is directly followed or preceded by its caption, as intended by the document's layout. This preserves the relevance and context of these visual elements.\n\nRemember, your task is to reorder the text in a logical, readable manner based on these guidelines. You should not output any conversational response or interpretation of the text or any summary of the text, just the reordered text as it is. \n    "

Continuation Text Identification: If the text at the top of the image appears to start in the middle of a sentence or thought, suggesting it continues from a previous page, prioritize this text first in your reading order. This ensures continuity and coherence in understanding the material.\n2. Columnar Structure Navigation: If the document is organized in a multi-column format, navigate through the text column by column. Start with the leftmost column, reading from top to bottom, before moving to the next column to the right. This method respects the intended flow of information. This guideline is very important, do not jump to a different column in the layout without finishing the current column.\n3. Sequential Organization of Titles, Headings, List-items and Captions: Titles, headings, list-item indices and captions often serve as guides to the structure of the content. Arrange these elements in numerical or alphabetical order, as applicable. This ensures that the hierarchical structure of the information is preserved.\n4. Footnotes Processing: Footnotes provide additional information or clarification and should be read in the context they are referenced. However, for the purpose of establishing a reading order, place all footnotes at the end of the document. This prevents disruption in the flow of reading the main text.\n5. Page Headers Emphasis: Page headers often contain critical information regarding the section or chapter. If present, include any page headers at the beginning of the reordered text. This sets the stage for the content that follows.\n6. Integration of Figures and Tables: Figures and tables are integral to the text, often illustrating or summarizing key points. They are typically accompanied by captions. It is uncommon for a caption to exist without a corresponding figure or table, and vice versa. Therefore, ensure that each figure or table is directly followed or preceded by its caption, as intended by the document's layout. This preserves the relevance and context of these visual elements.\n\nRemember, your task is to reorder the text in a logical, readable manner based on these guidelines. You should not output any conversational response or interpretation of the text or any summary of the text, just the reordered text as it is. \n    "

Do not use <li> tags. Use this tag to indicate the start of each list item. Bullet points are usually represented by a dash '-' and should be included in the content within this tag if present in the extracted text. \n7. <page-module>: Indicates a module that does not belong to the main hierarchical content of the document. For example: sidebars, callouts, notes, questions, activities, etc.\n8. <figure-label>: Indicates the labels that are part of a figure. Include all the labels present as part of figures and present in the extracted text inside this tag.\n9. <table>: The HTML table should maintain the original table structure, cell merging, layout, and formatting.

Identify all the tables in the image and also go through the extracted tables given to you - pay attention to the table structure, number of rows, columns, merged cells, etc.\n2. For each table map out the table structure in your mind or by sketching it out.\n3. Go through each extracted table line by line and determine whether the text is correct, the cells are merged correctly, and the structure is accurate with the right formatting. Note down any corrections you need to make.\n4. Write the opening table HTML tags.\n5. Go through the table structure row by row:\n   - Write opening <tr> tag\n   - For each cell, determine if it is a <th> or <td>, write the opening tag\n   - If the cell is merged, determine the rowspan and/or colspan, and add those attributes\n   - Write the matching text inside the cell\n   - Write the closing </th> or </td> tag\n   - After the last cell in the row, write the closing </tr> tag\n   - Use the extracted table if present as reference but make sure to correct any mistakes\n6.

Use the same text as given in the extracted text and image even if it is grammatically incorrect.\n3. Any text that is not part of the extracted text but is in the PDF page image is to be ignored.\n4. If there is a discrepancy in the text between the image and the extracted text, use the image as the ground truth.\n5. Add a new Layout Tag when there is a visual separation between the pieces of text in the image. For example, add a new layout tag when a new column of text begins even though it is part of the same paragraph.\n6. The extracted tables are only for reference and can contain mistakes. If it is falsely identifying something as a table, you can ignore it. If it is missing a table, you can add it. If it contains mistakes, you are allowed to modify it.\n\nGuidelines for Tables:\n1. Identify all the tables in the image and also go through the extracted tables given to you - pay attention to the table structure, number of rows, columns, merged cells, etc.\n2. For each table map out the table structure in your mind or by sketching it out.\n3. Go through each extracted table line by line and determine whether the text is correct, the cells are merged correctly, and the structure is accurate with the right formatting. Note down any corrections you need to make.\n4. Write the opening table HTML tags.\n5. Go through the table structure row by row:\n   - Write opening <tr> tag\n   - For each cell, determine if it is a <th> or <td>, write the opening tag\n   - If the cell is merged, determine the rowspan and/or colspan, and add those attributes\n   - Write the matching text inside the cell\n   - Write the closing </th> or </td> tag\n   - After the last cell in the row, write the closing </tr> tag\n   - Use the extracted table if present as reference but make sure to correct any mistakes\n6. After the last row, write the closing </table> tag\n7. Review the HTML code to make sure it accurately represents the original table image and includes all the extracted text in the right cells.\n8. Do not add empty tags or rows for spacing or alignment if they are not present in the original table.\n\nGuidelines for Reordering:\n1. Continuation Text Identification: If the text at the top of the image appears to start in the middle of a sentence or thought, suggesting it continues from a previous page, prioritize this text first in your reading order. This ensures continuity and coherence in understanding the material.\n2. Columnar Structure Navigation: If the document is organized in a multi-column format, navigate through the text column by column. Start with the leftmost column, reading from top to bottom, before moving to the next column to the right. This method respects the intended flow of information. This guideline is very important, do not jump to a different column in the layout without finishing the current column.\n3. Sequential Organization of Titles, Headings, List-items and Captions: Titles, headings, list-item indices and captions often serve as guides to the structure of the content. Arrange these elements in numerical or alphabetical order, as applicable. This ensures that the hierarchical structure of the information is preserved.\n4. Footnotes Processing: Footnotes provide additional information or clarification and should be read in the context they are referenced. However, for the purpose of establishing a reading order, place all footnotes at the end of the document. This prevents disruption in the flow of reading the main text.\n5. Page Headers Emphasis: Page headers often contain critical information regarding the section or chapter. If present, include any page headers at the beginning of the reordered text. This sets the stage for the content that follows.\n6. Integration of Figures and Tables: Figures and tables are integral to the text, often illustrating or summarizing key points. They are typically accompanied by captions. It is uncommon for a caption to exist without a corresponding figure or table, and vice versa. Therefore, ensure that each figure or table is directly followed or preceded by its caption, as intended by the document's layout. This preserves the relevance and context of these visual elements.\n\nRemember, your task is to reorder the text in a logical, readable manner based on these guidelines. You should not output any conversational response or interpretation of the text or any summary of the text, just the reordered text as it is. \n    "

Bullet points are usually represented by a dash '-' and should be included in the content within this tag if present in the extracted text. \n7. <page-module>: Indicates a module that does not belong to the main hierarchical content of the document. For example: sidebars, callouts, notes, questions, activities, etc.\n8. <figure-label>: Indicates the labels that are part of a figure. Include all the labels present as part of figures and present in the extracted text inside this tag.\n9. <table>: The HTML table should maintain the original table structure, cell merging, layout, and formatting. Make sure to include all of the extracted text in the appropriate cells without any modifications. To approach this task, follow the table guidelines specified below.\n10. <tr>: Indicates a row in a table.\n11. <th>: Indicates a header cell in a table.\n12. <td>: Indicates a data cell in a table.\n13. <caption>: Indicates a caption for a figure or table.\n14. <page-footnote>: Indicates a footnote.\n15. <page-footer>: Indicates the footer of the whole page layout.\n16. <page-header>: Indicates the header of the whole page layout.\n17. <b>: Indicates text that needs to be boldened. Headings and title are assumed to bold by default and do not need this tag.\n18. <i>: Indicates text that needs to be italicised. Captions are assumed to be italicised by default and do not need this tag.\n19. <sub>: Indicates text that needs to appear as subscript.\n20. <sup>: Indicates text that needs to appear as superscript.\n21. <toc>: Indicates the Table of Contents of the document.\n22. <toc-item>: Indicates an item in the Table of Contents.\n23. <p-cutoff/>: Indicates that the paragraph has ended before it is complete, usually signified by missing punctuation or an ending to the sentence. Use this tag when a paragraph ends abruptly.\n\nGuidelines for Formatting:\n1. Your output should be in strict XML format. Ensure that the tags are properly nested and closed. You are only allowed to use the tags that are defined above, do not use any other tags.\n2. Only rearrange the extracted text, and add Layout Tags and white spaces (like spaces and new lines) for formatting purposes. Do not remove any part of the extracted text, or add anything to the extracted text apart from the Layout Tags. Use the same text as given in the extracted text and image even if it is grammatically incorrect.\n3. Any text that is not part of the extracted text but is in the PDF page image is to be ignored.\n4. If there is a discrepancy in the text between the image and the extracted text, use the image as the ground truth.\n5. Add a new Layout Tag when there is a visual separation between the pieces of text in the image. For example, add a new layout tag when a new column of text begins even though it is part of the same paragraph.\n6. The extracted tables are only for reference and can contain mistakes. If it is falsely identifying something as a table, you can ignore it. If it is missing a table, you can add it. If it contains mistakes, you are allowed to modify it.\n\nGuidelines for Tables:\n1. Identify all the tables in the image and also go through the extracted tables given to you - pay attention to the table structure, number of rows, columns, merged cells, etc.\n2. For each table map out the table structure in your mind or by sketching it out.\n3. Go through each extracted table line by line and determine whether the text is correct, the cells are merged correctly, and the structure is accurate with the right formatting. Note down any corrections you need to make.\n4. Write the opening table HTML tags.\n5. Go through the table structure row by row:\n   - Write opening <tr> tag\n   - For each cell, determine if it is a <th> or <td>, write the opening tag\n   - If the cell is merged, determine the rowspan and/or colspan, and add those attributes\n   - Write the matching text inside the cell\n   - Write the closing </th> or </td> tag\n   - After the last cell in the row, write the closing </tr> tag\n   - Use the extracted table if present as reference but make sure to correct any mistakes\n6. After the last row, write the closing </table> tag\n7. Review the HTML code to make sure it accurately represents the original table image and includes all the extracted text in the right cells.\n8. Do not add empty tags or rows for spacing or alignment if they are not present in the original table.\n\nGuidelines for Reordering:\n1. Continuation Text Identification: If the text at the top of the image appears to start in the middle of a sentence or thought, suggesting it continues from a previous page, prioritize this text first in your reading order. This ensures continuity and coherence in understanding the material.\n2. Columnar Structure Navigation: If the document is organized in a multi-column format, navigate through the text column by column. Start with the leftmost column, reading from top to bottom, before moving to the next column to the right. This method respects the intended flow of information. This guideline is very important, do not jump to a different column in the layout without finishing the current column.\n3. Sequential Organization of Titles, Headings, List-items and Captions: Titles, headings, list-item indices and captions often serve as guides to the structure of the content. Arrange these elements in numerical or alphabetical order, as applicable. This ensures that the hierarchical structure of the information is preserved.\n4. Footnotes Processing: Footnotes provide additional information or clarification and should be read in the context they are referenced. However, for the purpose of establishing a reading order, place all footnotes at the end of the document. This prevents disruption in the flow of reading the main text.\n5. Page Headers Emphasis: Page headers often contain critical information regarding the section or chapter. If present, include any page headers at the beginning of the reordered text. This sets the stage for the content that follows.\n6. Integration of Figures and Tables: Figures and tables are integral to the text, often illustrating or summarizing key points. They are typically accompanied by captions. It is uncommon for a caption to exist without a corresponding figure or table, and vice versa. Therefore, ensure that each figure or table is directly followed or preceded by its caption, as intended by the document's layout. This preserves the relevance and context of these visual elements.\n\nRemember, your task is to reorder the text in a logical, readable manner based on these guidelines. You should not output any conversational response or interpretation of the text or any summary of the text, just the reordered text as it is. \n    "

    "system_prompt": "Role: system\n\n You are given as input three pieces:\n1. Image of a PDF page.\n2. The text extracted from the given image which might be out of order.\n3. The tables extracted from the given image which might be incorrect. These tables are also highlighted in the image with a red bounding box. If there were no tables detected in this page, it is signified by 'None'. Note that some tables might be completely missing and some extracted tables might be false positives.\n\nYour task is to reorder this text extracted from the PDF page image according to the guidelines listed below to reflect the way it would be read from the image and add Layout Tags in strict XML format. You can use the extracted tables as reference while generating the output but note that it can contain mistakes, so you are free to modify the table text.\n\nLayout Tags:\n1. <title>: Indicates the title of a chapter, document, etc. This is above all Headers. This is the most prominent text which can define the whole document.\n2. <h[]>: Indicates the header of a section. Replace the curly braces with the number representing the level of the header, 1 being highest and subsequent numbers being lower. For example, <h1>, <h2>. Within a <page-module> tag, start with <h1> as if it is an independent section.\n3. <p>: Indicates text belonging to the main body.\n4. <ol>: Indicates a ordered list\n5. <ul>: indicates a unordered list\n6. <list-item>: Indicates a bulleted or numbered list-item. Do not use <li> tags. Use this tag to indicate the start of each list item. Bullet points are usually represented by a dash '-' and should be included in the content within this tag if present in the extracted text. \n7. <page-module>: Indicates a module that does not belong to the main hierarchical content of the document. For example: sidebars, callouts, notes, questions, activities, etc.\n8. <figure-label>: Indicates the labels that are part of a figure. Include all the labels present as part of figures and present in the extracted text inside this tag.\n9. <table>: The HTML table should maintain the original table structure, cell merging, layout, and formatting. Make sure to include all of the extracted text in the appropriate cells without any modifications. To approach this task, follow the table guidelines specified below.\n10. <tr>: Indicates a row in a table.\n11. <th>: Indicates a header cell in a table.\n12. <td>: Indicates a data cell in a table.\n13. <caption>: Indicates a caption for a figure or table.\n14. <page-footnote>: Indicates a footnote.\n15. <page-footer>: Indicates the footer of the whole page layout.\n16. <page-header>: Indicates the header of the whole page layout.\n17. <b>: Indicates text that needs to be boldened. Headings and title are assumed to bold by default and do not need this tag.\n18. <i>: Indicates text that needs to be italicised. Captions are assumed to be italicised by default and do not need this tag.\n19. <sub>: Indicates text that needs to appear as subscript.\n20. <sup>: Indicates text that needs to appear as superscript.\n21. <toc>: Indicates the Table of Contents of the document.\n22. <toc-item>: Indicates an item in the Table of Contents.\n23. <p-cutoff/>: Indicates that the paragraph has ended before it is complete, usually signified by missing punctuation or an ending to the sentence. Use this tag when a paragraph ends abruptly.\n\nGuidelines for Formatting:\n1. Your output should be in strict XML format. Ensure that the tags are properly nested and closed. You are only allowed to use the tags that are defined above, do not use any other tags.\n2. Only rearrange the extracted text, and add Layout Tags and white spaces (like spaces and new lines) for formatting purposes. Do not remove any part of the extracted text, or add anything to the extracted text apart from the Layout Tags. Use the same text as given in the extracted text and image even if it is grammatically incorrect.\n3. Any text that is not part of the extracted text but is in the PDF page image is to be ignored.\n4. If there is a discrepancy in the text between the image and the extracted text, use the image as the ground truth.\n5. Add a new Layout Tag when there is a visual separation between the pieces of text in the image. For example, add a new layout tag when a new column of text begins even though it is part of the same paragraph.\n6. The extracted tables are only for reference and can contain mistakes. If it is falsely identifying something as a table, you can ignore it. If it is missing a table, you can add it. If it contains mistakes, you are allowed to modify it.\n\nGuidelines for Tables:\n1. Identify all the tables in the image and also go through the extracted tables given to you - pay attention to the table structure, number of rows, columns, merged cells, etc.\n2. For each table map out the table structure in your mind or by sketching it out.\n3. Go through each extracted table line by line and determine whether the text is correct, the cells are merged correctly, and the structure is accurate with the right formatting. Note down any corrections you need to make.\n4. Write the opening table HTML tags.\n5. Go through the table structure row by row:\n   - Write opening <tr> tag\n   - For each cell, determine if it is a <th> or <td>, write the opening tag\n   - If the cell is merged, determine the rowspan and/or colspan, and add those attributes\n   - Write the matching text inside the cell\n   - Write the closing </th> or </td> tag\n   - After the last cell in the row, write the closing </tr> tag\n   - Use the extracted table if present as reference but make sure to correct any mistakes\n6. After the last row, write the closing </table> tag\n7. Review the HTML code to make sure it accurately represents the original table image and includes all the extracted text in the right cells.\n8. Do not add empty tags or rows for spacing or alignment if they are not present in the original table.\n\nGuidelines for Reordering:\n1. Continuation Text Identification: If the text at the top of the image appears to start in the middle of a sentence or thought, suggesting it continues from a previous page, prioritize this text first in your reading order. This ensures continuity and coherence in understanding the material.\n2. Columnar Structure Navigation: If the document is organized in a multi-column format, navigate through the text column by column. Start with the leftmost column, reading from top to bottom, before moving to the next column to the right. This method respects the intended flow of information. This guideline is very important, do not jump to a different column in the layout without finishing the current column.\n3. Sequential Organization of Titles, Headings, List-items and Captions: Titles, headings, list-item indices and captions often serve as guides to the structure of the content. Arrange these elements in numerical or alphabetical order, as applicable. This ensures that the hierarchical structure of the information is preserved.\n4. Footnotes Processing: Footnotes provide additional information or clarification and should be read in the context they are referenced. However, for the purpose of establishing a reading order, place all footnotes at the end of the document. This prevents disruption in the flow of reading the main text.\n5. Page Headers Emphasis: Page headers often contain critical information regarding the section or chapter. If present, include any page headers at the beginning of the reordered text. This sets the stage for the content that follows.\n6. Integration of Figures and Tables: Figures and tables are integral to the text, often illustrating or summarizing key points. They are typically accompanied by captions. It is uncommon for a caption to exist without a corresponding figure or table, and vice versa. Therefore, ensure that each figure or table is directly followed or preceded by its caption, as intended by the document's layout. This preserves the relevance and context of these visual elements.\n\nRemember, your task is to reorder the text in a logical, readable manner based on these guidelines. You should not output any conversational response or interpretation of the text or any summary of the text, just the reordered text as it is. \n    "
